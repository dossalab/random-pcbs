# My collection of random PCBs (printed-circuit-boards)

These things are too minor to create separate repositories for them.

## What's included

Name | Description | Notes
-----|-------------|------
ble-receiver | Small board based on NRF52832 with 6 standard servo connectors. Intended for small toys or robots | Voltage monitoring circuit is not 'ideal' - can be omitted
ips-display-breakout | Breakout for ST7789-based 240x240 IPS display from Aliexpress |
library | Directory containing common footprints & libraries |
nrf-card | Development board in a size of a credit card containing NRF52832, SD card breakout, ST7789-based display and more | This was done before I discovered that NRF52 consumes 32 uA of current, so it has external RTC and unnecessary powerup logic.
sd-card-debug | SD/MMC card breakout board intended for JTAG debugging on Rockchip / Alwinner boards | Codename "dildo" - never ordered
